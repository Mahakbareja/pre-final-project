FINANCE TRACKING SYSTEM
Our project seeks to create a user-friendly Personal Finance Tracker website that will help people manage their finances more successfully. The webpage's key components are cost tracking, budgeting, income tracking, and goal setting.

The site is designed for users who want to enhance their financial literacy and manage their spending habits. It will give a handy platform for users to evaluate their financial health, set budget limitations, and track progress toward their financial goals. Expected outcomes include increased financial knowledge, better decision-making, and more customerÂ happiness.
